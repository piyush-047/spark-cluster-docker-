Spark Cluster with Docker 🐳
This repository contains a containerized setup for deploying an Apache Spark cluster using Docker and Docker Compose. It simplifies the process of running a distributed Spark environment for local development, testing, or deployment in production.

📚 Features
Pre-configured Spark Master and Worker Nodes
Horizontal Scaling: Easily scale worker nodes with Docker Compose.
Custom Spark Configurations: Update Spark settings via configuration files.
Multi-host Deployment: Suitable for deployment on Hetzner servers or similar platforms.
Monitoring Tools: Access Spark Web UI to monitor tasks and jobs.
🚀 Quick Start Guide
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Docker
Docker Compose
Steps to Get Started
Clone the repository:


bash
Copy code
docker-compose build
Start the Spark Cluster:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
Access the Spark Master Web UI:

arduino
Copy code
http://localhost:8080
Scale the worker nodes as needed:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --scale spark-worker=3
🛠️ Configuration
